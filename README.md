## Abstract
This project explores Twitter sentiment analysis using PySpark in a big data environment. It leverages the distributed processing capabilities of PySpark on platforms like AWS EMR clusters and Google Colaboratory.

The analysis employs Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) techniques with libraries like Matplotlib and Seaborn to gain insights from the Twitter data. The sentiment polarity of tweets (positive, negative, neutral) is likely predicted using machine learning algorithms within the PySpark framework.

This project demonstrates a scalable approach to sentiment analysis on large Twitter datasets, potentially enabling real-time analysis of public opinion on various topics.

## Description of the Dataset
For this I merged 2 datasets adding up to almost 14GB.
There were almost 18 million tweets in the dataset.
